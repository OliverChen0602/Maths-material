# Maths-helpsheet
## Description
This repository contains cheatsheets for some modules taken by the author in his undergraduate career in Kent Ridge Polytechnic, or more famously known as National University of Singapore, or NUS. Although the repository is named as maths-helpsheet, not all modules are MA-coded. The author also takes modules from computer science and data science and analytics. In general, the cheatsheets are prepared mainly for midterms and finals. All files are typed by LaTeX.
## Acknowledgement
All cheatsheets are totally written independently by the author. Labour matters. Since cheatsheets are used to assist exams, they are forced to be in two pages. As a result, they are formatted in a very compact manner. The ultimate goal is not to maximize eye comfort, but to maximize the amount of information stored in limited space.

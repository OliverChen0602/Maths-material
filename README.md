# Maths-material
## Description
This repository contains materials for some modules taken or taugut by the author in his undergraduate career in Kent Ridge Polytechnic, or more famously known as National University of Singapore, or NUS. Although the repository is named as maths-material, not all modules are MA-coded. The author also takes modules from computer science and data science and analytics. In general, the cheatsheets are prepared mainly for midterms and finals. All cheatsheets are typed by LaTeX.

On the other hand, the author has a strong passion in teaching. He was lab tutor for CS2030 in AY2022/2023 semester 2, and is tutor for CS1010E in the current semester. For benefits of learners and teachers, the author will also upload teaching materials he used throughout the semester, such as slides and other supplementary files. If material is referenced from other's work, citation and gratitude will be clearly stated.
## Acknowledgement
All cheatsheets are totally written independently by the author. Labour matters. Since cheatsheets are used to assist exams, they are forced to be in two pages. As a result, they are formatted in a very compact manner. The ultimate goal is not to maximize eye comfort, but to maximize the amount of information stored in limited space.
